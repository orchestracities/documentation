**Orchestra Cities** is a data and IoT-driven solution that allows cities to
collaboratively develop and share Smart City Services using Open APIs and
Open Standards. Launched in 2018, Orchestra Cities was initially developed
and tested with Antwerp and Helsinki. 
This initial work on the platform was lead by
[Martel Innovate](https://www.martel-innovate.com) with
the support of [Ubiwhere](https://www.ubiwhere.com/)
and [Therapaenis](http://www.therapaenis.com/).

The current work is driven by [Martel Innovate](https://www.martel-innovate.com)
that offers a commercial version of the platform and private deployment support
for it (for more information [OrchestraCities.com](https://orchestracities.com))
currently trialled in Germany.

The tutorial presented in this refers to endpoints the commercial platform
(which is the only public live instance available),
nevertheless you can apply the same tutorials for your own deployment
based on the open source tools that are composing the platform.

Orchestra Cities contributes and is based on [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org).
