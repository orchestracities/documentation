**Orchestra Cities** is a data and IoT-driven solution that allows cities to
collaboratively develop and share Smart City Services using Open APIs and
Open Standards. Launched in 2018 by [Martel Innovate](https://www.martel-innovate.com),
Orchestra Cities was initially developed and tested with Antwerp and Helsinki
as solution for the [Select4Cities](https://www.select4cities.eu/)
Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP). Following the PCP, Martel further invested
on the platform for the benefit of its customers.
